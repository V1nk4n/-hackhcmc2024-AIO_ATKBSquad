## Description

Our hackathon project focuses on [Digital Empowerment] to enhance digital experiences. We have developed an innovative solution using an ensemble model approach. Our solution utilizes EasyOCR and image captioning models to extract insights from images. These insights are then analyzed using the large language model LLAMA3. This enables automatic detection and evaluation of various elements crucial for brand experience enhancement at HEINEKEN Vietnam, including brand logos (Heineken, Tiger, Bia Viet, Larue, Bivina, Edelweiss, Strongbow), product identification (beer crates and bottles), customer engagement, advertising materials (posters, banners, signage), and contextual details (venues like restaurants, bars, grocery stores).
